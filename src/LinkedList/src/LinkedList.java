/* Linked Lists:
 * Linked Lists (LL) are commonly compared to array lists, because they are both dynamic in length as opposed to arrays which are fixed in length.
 * One main difference between array lists and LL, is LL's do not have indexes assigned directly to a particular item in the list. Rather it has items (nodes) that point to the next one in sequence until it gets to the end. The final node will point to null.
 * LL items are also not in a contiguous place in memory, rather they are all spread out. That is why it cannot have indexes, because the items are spread in memory and not adjoining.
 *
 * Variables (pointers that 'point' to nodes):
 *   - head (points to first node)
 *   - tail (points to last node)
 *
 * Methods in Linked Lists and their Big O:
 *  **for reference, 'n' refers to the number of nodes in the LL**
 *
 * - Appending node:
 *   - O(1)
 *
 * - Removing node:
 *   - O(n)
 *
 * - Prepending node:
 *   - O(1)
 *
 * - Removing first node:
 *   - O(1)
 *
 * - Inserting a node inside list:
 *   - O(n)
 *
 * - Finding a node:
 *   - O(n)
 *
 * Linked Lists under the hood:
 *
 * What is a node?
 *   - It is both a value and a pointer
 *   - We can think of a node like a Hash Map:
 *       {
 *           "value" = 4,
 *           "next" = null
 *       }
 *   Therefore, as an example if we add this node into our linked list, the "next" value will point to the node in front of it (if applicable), and the node behind it will point to it.
 *

         * The dummy nodes have a value of 0 (or any default value), which is not part of the original list. This would corrupt your final list. When we create a new instance of Node, we must pass a value to the constructor if the Node class requires one. This ensures the object is properly initialized and avoids compilation errors.
         * Even though the value is not meaningful in the context of a dummy node, we still need to provide something for the Node object to be created.
